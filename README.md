 This repo contains code for generating a practice data set for an introductory first year bachelor course on data science and machine learning.

 The data set generated concerns (fictitious) ice cream sales in 2022, 2023 and 2024 in the Netherlands. On days on which the number of hours of sunshine is below a given threshold, the amount of ice cream sold (in thousands of litres) is random. On days with enough sunshine, it scales linearly with the average temperature recorded on that day. This teaches students about linear regression but also about classification (because there is a distinct class of observations for which the effect does not hold).

 Students are encouraged to think about what this means from a business perspective. Can they predict in advance how many litres of ice cream to produce and, if so, how good will their prediction be?
